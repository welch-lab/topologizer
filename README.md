# Installation and Usage
Install the python packages `networkx` and `kmapper` and the R packages `liger` (https://github.com/MacoskoLab/liger) and `reticulate`.
Then clone the repository, cd to the repository directory, and run `source("run_topologizer.R")` from an R session.
You can then build a topological representation of datasets analyzed with liger by calling the `run_topologizer` function directly on a liger object.
